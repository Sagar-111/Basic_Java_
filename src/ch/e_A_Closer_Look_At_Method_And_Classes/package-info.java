/*IN CASE THE RIGHT METHOD IS NOT INVOKED IN METHOD OVERLOADING.
 * Argument Type Mismatch: Ensure that the argument types exactly match one of the available overloaded methods. Java selects the method with the closest matching parameter types.

Widening/Narrowing Conversion: Verify that the data types being passed are compatible with the parameter types. Java may perform widening or narrowing conversions for primitive types based on the available methods.

Ambiguous Calls: Avoid situations where the argument types could match multiple overloaded methods equally well. This can lead to ambiguity, and Java might choose a different method than expected.*/
